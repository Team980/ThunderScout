    <string name="telemetry_prompt">
        ThunderScout uses Firebase Analytics to collect information such as usage statistics and crash reports.
        \n
        \nThis information is used to provide insight on app performance as well as fix bugs for future releases.
        \n
        \nYou can opt out of telemetry in the app settings.

    <!--- TODO These must be updated for every public release!-->

    <string name="update_notes">
        ThunderScout 2.0 (v15) has no release notes as of yet. EVERYTHING has changed.
        \n
        \nKnown issues:
        \n• The Bluetooth server may fail to receive matches logged as successfully sent by the client device.
        A solution for this is still being investigated.
        \n• The point calculations are deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
